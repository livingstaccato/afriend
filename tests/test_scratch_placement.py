"""Where a confined friend's scratch and state live (spec §12.2, §12.3).

The runner takes a snapshot of the repository and gives each repo-scope
friend its own `git worktree` of it, so every friend reviews the same
pristine tree. Pointing that friend's `$TMPDIR` and `$XDG_*` at its own
working directory undid half of that: the runner dirtied the tree it had
just gone to the trouble of isolating. A friend orienting itself with
`git status` saw two untracked directories that were not in the commit it
was reviewing, and the CLI's own config sat among the files it was asked to
critique.

Raised as a claim that deadlocked -- judges split on whether "inside the
isolation directory" meant the worktree or the tree that contains it. The
layout settles it: scratch goes BESIDE the working directory, under the
round's isolation root, which is torn down with everything else.

The bottom half runs a real sandboxed process. A grant that merely looks
right in a profile is worth nothing when the question is whether a friend
can actually write where it needs to and nowhere else.
