        # one -- see cli._specs_from_flags): the escapee is found instead
        # by grepping `ps` output for the literal marker comment below,
        # which -- like every `python -c "..."` invocation in this file --
        # appears verbatim in its command line.
        #
        # Reaping this process's OWN process group cannot reach the
        # escapee (same irreducible limitation as "escape" -- see
        # test_setsid_escapee_is_not_reaped in test_spawn.py), but this
        # process's inherited stdout/stderr pipes stay open as long as the
        # escapee (which never redirects them) is still running -- that is
        # spawn.run_process's SECOND, independent orphans_suspected
        # signal (see its module docstring): the output-pump threads are
        # still alive, well past the drain window, even though this
        # process itself already exited cleanly and fast.
        #
        # The escapee signals *after* os.setsid() returns, and this process
        # waits for that signal before exiting. Without the wait the mode
        # races: this process exits, the runner sweeps its group, and the
        # SIGTERM lands while the escapee is still starting up and still a
        # member of that group -- so it gets killed instead of escaping,
        # the inherited pipes close, and orphans_suspected comes back False.
        # Wide enough on a fast machine to almost never lose; observed
        # losing consistently under an emulated Linux container, where
        # interpreter startup is several seconds.
