"""Tests for resolution verification and the gate rule (spec §6.4, §7.5).

Weighted toward what §6.4 says a resolution is *not*: it is an attestation,
not proof, and the runner's only real check is whether the location the
author named actually changed. Two rules carry the weight — a resolution is
never rejected merely because the reviewed artifact is unchanged, and a
`fixed` naming an unchanged location is the one case the runner can
positively contradict.
