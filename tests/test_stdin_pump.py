"""The stdin pump must not block forever on an inherited pipe (c-0010).

The output pumps were built non-blocking precisely because a descendant that
inherits a friend's stdio can hold a pipe open after the friend itself has
gone. `_pump_stdin` used a plain synchronous `write()`, so the same
descendant holding fd 0 open -- while never reading it -- blocks that write
once the pipe buffer fills. The thread is a daemon, so the process can still
exit, but within a run it never returns: a runner dispatching many friends
accumulates one stuck thread per affected friend, each pinning the prompt
buffer.

A prompt larger than the pipe buffer is the precondition, and prompts here
carry the whole artifact, so it is not a small input.
