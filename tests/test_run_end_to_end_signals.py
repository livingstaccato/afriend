"""End-to-end tests for `afriend run --mode report`: signal-driven teardown
(Task 12 review, Finding 1), orphaned-descendant surfacing, and `afriend
doctor`.

Proven here by actually sending SIGTERM/SIGINT to a real `afriend run`
process and inspecting real OS/git state afterward -- mutation testing
(used throughout the original submission) cannot reach this bug at all,
since it is specifically about what happens when Python's normal
exception-unwinding machinery never gets a chance to run. Reproduced
manually first (exact commands and output are in the task report) before
being written as these automated tests.

See tests/e2e_helpers.py for the safe-PATH subprocess harness this file (and
its siblings test_run_end_to_end_basics.py and
test_run_end_to_end_isolation.py) share.

    (not the safe-PATH restricted one -- this reads the test's own host
    process table, nothing to do with what `afriend` itself can execute).

    `-ww` is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Without it `ps` truncates the
    command column to the terminal width, defaulting to 80 when there is no
    tty -- and the `pid`/`ppid` columns eat 16 of those, leaving 64. Every
    caller below identifies processes by substring-matching the command
    (`"fake_friend.py" in cmd`, `"hang" in cmd`, the escapee's marker
    comment), and all of those substrings sit *after* a long absolute path,
    so they were being cut off entirely. That made the signal-teardown
    tests fail on a CI runner whose checkout path was long enough to blow
    the 64-character budget, while passing locally and in a container where
    it was not, reported as "friend process never started" when the friend
