"""A friend's output is bounded in bytes, not only in seconds (c-0002).

Cross-examining normalize.py surfaced this about its neighbours: stdout,
stderr and HTTP response bodies were accumulated with no ceiling, so the
documented timeout bounded how LONG a friend could run but nothing about how
much memory it could make this process hold. A friend looping on output --
the repetition-looping local model this codebase already designs around --
fills RAM until something dies, and the runner dispatches friends
concurrently, so it is not one friend's memory at stake.

Truncated output is never repaired, matching the rule already applied to a
timed-out friend: a killed friend's partial output is a failed round, not a
parsing candidate. Silently keeping a prefix would be worse than failing,
because a prefix can still parse.
