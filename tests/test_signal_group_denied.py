"""`os.killpg` raising EPERM must not crash the round (c-0011).

`_signal_group` caught only ProcessLookupError, so a PermissionError from
`os.killpg` propagated out of `_terminate_group` and out of `run_process`
itself -- taking down the friend whose answer had, in the reported case,
already been written and parsed.

Observed live before it was understood: a full test run failed with
`PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted`, which was initially
put down to interference from a concurrent run. agy raised it independently
in a cross-examination of spawn.py, which is what prompted actually reading
the exception handling.

EPERM and ESRCH mean opposite things here and must not be collapsed:
- ESRCH (ProcessLookupError) -- nothing has that pgid. The group is gone,
  so there is nothing to reap and no orphan to suspect.
- EPERM (PermissionError) -- something DOES have that pgid and the kernel
  refused the signal. The group was not reaped, so an orphan is exactly
  what should be suspected. Reporting that as "gone" would claim a cleanup
  that did not happen.
