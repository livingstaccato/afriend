# --- Lens wiring (Task 13 coordinator finding) ----------------------------
#
# Before this fix, cmd_run built exactly one prompt.txt (PROMPT_HEADER +
# artifact) before the dispatch loop and handed the same Path to every
# friend regardless of --friend cli:lens. LENS_DIR/available_lenses() only
# ever harvested filename stems for round-robin assignment and bookkeeping
# (friend naming, claim origin/lens fields) -- no code path ever read a
# lens file's prose into a prompt. Every friend therefore received a
# byte-identical, lens-blind prompt: the only diversity in a run was model
# diversity, and the lens name on a claim was decorative. These tests prove
# the fix by reading the actual <friend>.prompt files a real run writes to
# disk, not by inspecting the runner's internals.
