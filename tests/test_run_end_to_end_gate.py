"""End-to-end `--mode gate` and `afriend resolve` (spec §6.4, §7.5).

The gate is the mode with teeth: it is the one that fails a build. These
check that it fails for the right reasons, clears for the right reasons, and
that a resolution is recorded as the attestation §6.4 says it is rather than
as proof of anything.

Two fixture details matter and are easy to get wrong:

* The artifact lives INSIDE a git repository, because a resolution is
  verified against the run's repository snapshot. An artifact in a bare
  tmp_path has no snapshot, so every location would come back
  `unverifiable` and the tests would pass while checking nothing.
* Friends are requested as `fake:<mode>:repo`. A snapshot is only taken when
  some friend actually needs repo scope, so a roster of doc-scope fakes
  produces a run with a null snapshot commit -- same vacuous outcome.
