"""C1 fixture item 4: one real captured-stdout fixture per shipped adapter,
asserted end to end through the REAL adapter TOML (adapters.load_adapters)
and the REAL unwrapping path in normalize.normalize -- not hand-built
Envelope objects (those are covered separately, at the mechanism level, in
test_normalize.py).

agy and opencode: the JSON below is byte-for-byte what was captured from
those exact CLIs (see adapters/agy.toml and adapters/opencode.toml, and the
whole-branch review that produced this file). Only agy's "findings" fixture
substitutes real findings JSON into the `response` field in place of the
captured "ok\\n" -- the captured success example never actually exercised a
real critique, so a second fixture proves the field, once isolated, is
handed back through the SAME extract/validate logic every other adapter
uses, not something bespoke to agy.

claude and codex: captured 2026-08-23 by running each CLI once on its own
subscription plan (not a metered API key) and saving stdout verbatim.
claude 2.1.240 emits a single JSON object with type="result" and the answer
in `result` as a JSON-escaped string. codex 0.149.0 emits an NDJSON event
stream -- thread.started, turn.started, item.completed, turn.completed --
with the answer in the item.completed event whose item.type is
"agent_message", at item.text. codex additionally writes a non-JSON line
("Reading additional input from stdin...") to stdout, so its fixture also
exercises the NDJSON reader's requirement to skip unparseable lines rather
than fail on them.

opencode_error_then_findings.ndjson / agy_response_prose_with_top_level_findings.json:
added for the whole-branch re-review's Regression 1 -- an envelope rule
matching something OTHER than the real answer (a benign "rate limited,
retrying" error event; a `response` field full of unrelated prose) must not
make normalize() commit to that match exclusively when real findings are
sitting elsewhere in the same output (a second NDJSON line; the envelope
object's own top-level `findings` key). Both still use the real, declared
`[envelope]` for their adapter -- only the surrounding content is
constructed to reproduce the regression, not the envelope shape itself.
