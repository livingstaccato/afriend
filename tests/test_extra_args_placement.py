"""Operator flags must land in a flag position, not after the prompt (c-0005).

Dispatch appended `--unsafe-extra-args` to the end of argv, which is a flag
position only when the prompt never enters argv at all. For the other two
prompt modes the prompt is at or near the end, so appended flags became stray
positionals -- silently doing nothing, or displacing the prompt from where
the CLI reads it. That is the exact trap `build_argv`'s docstring documents,
in the one place that bypasses `build_argv`.

Raised as a deadlocked claim: judges split because neither side ran it. The
argv settles it, which is why this file exists.
