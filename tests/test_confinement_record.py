"""What a run records about withheld environment variables (§12.2).

The list reaches run.json and report.md as the run's evidence that secrets
were kept from executable friends, so it has to describe what dispatch will
actually do rather than an approximation of it. A crossexam of
commands/run.py found it doing neither.
