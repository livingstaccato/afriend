"""OS confinement for a CLI that already has a read-only mode (§12.2).

A read-only flag stops a friend WRITING and says nothing about what it may
READ. Measured against the real codex on 2026-08-28: under its own
`--sandbox read-only` and nothing else, asked to list `~/.ssh`, it listed the
directory. Under this runner's sandbox the same request came back "the
filesystem sandbox denied access (Operation not permitted)".

The opt-in is per adapter rather than blanket because confinement breaks a
CLI whose credentials the sandbox cannot reach: claude keeps its own in the
macOS Keychain and reports "Not logged in" under any profile that does not
grant `~/Library/Keychains` -- and granting that would hand a friend every
credential the operator has, which is worse than the gap it closes. agy is
left out deliberately; provoking its re-authentication has cost a login before.
