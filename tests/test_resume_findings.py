"""Findings from cross-examining `commands/run.py`: c-0001, c-0003, c-0004,
c-0006, c-0011.

Five claims, one cause. `--mode loop --merge orchestrator` halts once per
iteration, and almost nothing survived the halt: the claim counter was
recomputed from a list that merges had shrunk, the resumed judging round was
handed none of what earlier iterations decided, the dry-round streak was
zeroed by a constant, and the adjudication response could be applied twice.

Each test here fails against the previous behaviour. That was checked rather
than assumed -- a test for a resume path that only ever runs the new code is
worth very little.
