"""End-to-end `--mode loop` (spec §7.3).

A loop is repeated crossexam iterations over the same artifact. **The runner
never edits an artifact** (§7.5), so what a loop actually buys is two things:
convergence detection -- proving a roster keeps finding the same things and
nothing more -- and picking up a revision if something outside the run made
one between iterations.

That makes the interesting assertions about round numbering (iterations must
not collide in the run directory or the ledger), the dry-round streak, and
the ceilings, rather than about the artifact changing.
