"""A pipe that fails mid-stream is not a clean end of stream.

`_pump_output` treated every OSError from `os.read` exactly like EOF: break,
append the final decode, return. A transport failure and an orderly close
were therefore indistinguishable, and the caller parsed whatever bytes had
arrived before the failure -- reporting a fraction of a friend's answer as
the whole of it. That is the mistake the byte ceiling and the timeout both
exist to prevent, one layer further down.

Selector setup had the same shape of problem: it ran before the try/finally,
so a failure there skipped the stream close, leaving the pipe undrained. The
friend then blocked on it until its own timeout, and the operator saw a
timeout rather than the real cause.
