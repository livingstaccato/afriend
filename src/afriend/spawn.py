"""Run one friend under a timeout, in its own process group.

Agent CLIs spawn descendants -- MCP servers, shells, language servers -- so
killing only the parent on timeout leaves them running, making network calls
and writing files after the run has been marked incomplete. Hence process
groups: SIGTERM to the whole group, a grace period, then SIGKILL to the whole
group. A friend can also leave a descendant running after exiting 0 (it never
timed out at all), so the same sweep runs after every round, not only after a
timeout -- see `run_process`.

Exit status is not evidence of success either: a friend can exit 0 while
answering an unrelated prompt, or after writing its findings somewhere other
than stdout. A round only counts as succeeded when exit is 0 AND stdout
parsed AND normalize() found at least one claim or an explicit
`{"no_findings": true}` marker. A timeout always takes precedence over
parsing: a killed friend's truncated output never enters the repair path, it
is simply a failed round.

Two more things worth calling out because they are easy to miss:

`subprocess.Popen.communicate()` does not return once the process we spawned
has exited -- it returns once the process has exited *and* both its stdout
and stderr pipes have hit EOF. Any subprocess call that does not explicitly
redirect stdio inherits fds 0/1/2 from its parent regardless of `close_fds`
(that only governs fds >= 3), so a descendant the friend spawned and never
waited on can hold our stdout/stderr pipes open long after the friend itself
has finished and printed its answer -- built on `communicate()`, that would
misreport a real, fast success as a timeout. This module avoids
`communicate()` for exactly that reason: stdin is written and stdout/stderr
are drained on background threads, while the main flow polls `process.poll()`
directly to learn when *our* child is done, independent of whether any pipe
has reached EOF.

A descendant that leaves the process group entirely (calling its own
`os.setsid()` before this module can intervene -- see `test_setsid_escapee_is_not_reaped`)
can hold a stdout/stderr pipe open forever; nothing this process does can
force it closed. A pump thread blocked in a plain, buffered `readline()`
cannot be reliably unblocked from another thread either -- verified directly
on this runtime: closing the file object from a different thread while a
`readline()` call is blocked inside it does not make that call return.
Reading is therefore done through a non-blocking fd polled with `selectors`,
so a pump thread is never stuck in a syscall it can't get back out of: it is
always back at a `stop_event` check within one `_POLL_INTERVAL_S`.

    blocking for the rest of `timeout_s` regardless of what the caller
    wants. Default `None` means this call behaves exactly as before: no new

    # instant keeps ITS code, since termination of an empty job changes
