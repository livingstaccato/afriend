"""The halt/resume handshake for judgment the runner cannot make -- §4.2.

Deduplication is judgment. `--merge=exact` under-merges on purpose, because
guessing at equivalence corrupts termination arithmetic; but it means two
friends describing one defect in different words produce two claims, and the
report shows one problem twice.

`--merge=orchestrator` hands that judgment out. The runner writes
`round-N/REQUEST.json`, exits 10, and stops. Something with judgment -- an
agent driving this skill, or a person -- writes `RESPONSE.json`. `afriend run
--resume RUN_ID` reads it and continues.

**The same response must always produce the same run.** That is what makes
mode drivers deterministic and lets fixtures ship canned responses, so this
module applies a response as data rather than re-deciding anything.

**A response is checked, not trusted.** It arrives as a file on disk, written
by another process, naming claim ids that become permanent ledger records. A
merge naming an id that does not exist, or a chain of merges, would corrupt
the alias graph in ways only discovered much later while reading a report --
so every referenced id is resolved and every structural rule is enforced
before a single Alias is written.
