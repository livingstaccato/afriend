"""Trust boundary for roster files and constructed argv.

A cloned repository is hostile input. Rather than blocklisting dangerous flag
spellings — which missed config overrides, inline settings JSON carrying
hooks, writable --add-dir, and profile layering — the roster is restricted to
values for a fixed set of keys. There is no mechanism for it to inject flags.

The value-level check that remains is direction-aware on purpose: refusing to
start because someone asked for a *safer* sandbox would be its own bug.
