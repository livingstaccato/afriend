"""Snapshot the repository and hand each friend an isolated copy.

`git stash create` is deliberately not used: its synopsis is
`git stash create [<message>]` with no -u, so it omits untracked files. A
newly added file would then appear in the diff artifact but be missing from
the worktree, forcing every claim about it to 'unverifiable' and blaming the
judge for a broken snapshot. Instead, a temporary index is populated with
`git add -A` (tracked, staged, and untracked-but-not-ignored files alike) and
turned into a commit object with `commit-tree`, without ever touching the
operator's real index or working tree.
