"""Moving bytes to and from a friend without ever blocking on it.

A friend can spawn descendants that inherit its stdio, and one that calls its
own `os.setsid()` leaves the process group entirely -- so a pipe can stay open
long after the friend itself has exited, and nothing this process does can
force it closed. Every read and write here is therefore non-blocking and
polled with `selectors`, so a pump thread is always back at its stop check
within one `_POLL_INTERVAL_S` and can never be stuck in a syscall it cannot
get out of.

**This is the POSIX story.** Windows has no non-blocking polling primitive
for a pipe at all -- verified on this runtime: `selectors.DefaultSelector().
select()` on a pipe fd raises `OSError 10093`, because Windows' `select()`
only ever operates on sockets. The `_windows` variants below read and write
in a plain blocking loop instead, and lean on a different guarantee to stay
safe: `wingroup.py`'s Job Object never permits `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`,
so (unlike a POSIX `os.setsid()` escapee) a friend's descendant cannot
normally survive job termination to hold a pipe open forever. Terminating
the job therefore closes every handle in the tree essentially immediately,
which unblocks a pending `os.read()`/`os.write()` the same way closing every
group member's fd does on POSIX. See `spawn.run_process`'s Windows branch,
which terminates the job before joining these pump threads. The accepted
residual gap -- a descendant that somehow outlives job termination anyway --
hangs its pump thread forever; it is a daemon thread, so it costs nothing but
the `orphans_suspected` warning `run_process` already raises for exactly this
shape of leak.

Split out of spawn.py, which had grown past the then-current line cap.

    Writing synchronously on the main thread before polling starts would risk
    the classic pipe deadlock: a prompt larger than the OS pipe buffer blocks
    our write() until the friend reads more, but the friend may itself be
    blocked writing to its own full stdout pipe if nobody is draining it
    concurrently. Running the write here, alongside the output pumps, avoids
    that.

    Non-blocking for the same reason the output pumps are, which this
    function did not originally share. A plain `write()` blocks once the pipe
    buffer fills and nothing drains it -- and a descendant that inherited fd 0
    and never reads it does exactly that, holding the pipe open after the
    friend itself is gone. The thread is a daemon so the process can still
    exit, but within a run it never returns: a runner dispatching many friends
    accumulates one stuck thread per affected friend, each pinning a copy of
    the prompt. Prompts here carry the whole artifact, so the precondition --
    a prompt larger than the pipe buffer -- is ordinary rather than exotic.

    the pump keeps draining for `_DRAIN_JOIN_S` so a chunk already sitting in

    at the ceiling instead -- which is what this did first -- leaves the pipe

    bounds memory just as well and leaves the child able to exit on its own

    `failed_event`, when given, is set if the pipe fails in a way that is NOT

    reporting a fraction of a friend's answer as the whole of it. That is the
