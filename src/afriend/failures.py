"""Classifying why a friend failed, and noticing when it will keep failing.

Spec §14's table gives auth its own row because auth is **deterministic**: a
friend that cannot authenticate now cannot authenticate on the next round
either. §7.2 therefore aborts the run rather than "burning the remaining
rounds and iterations" -- with `--mode loop` at its defaults that is up to
five iterations of three rounds each, every one of them a dispatch that
cannot possibly succeed.

Two mechanisms here, and the difference between them matters:

**Classification (§14) is by adapter-declared marker, never by inference.**
The spec's reason is concrete: gemini emits extension-loader errors, a
true-color warning and a ripgrep notice to stderr on *every* invocation, so
matching "auth" or "unauthorized" against stderr has a real false-positive
rate. A false auth classification is expensive -- it aborts the whole run.

The spec went one step further and forbade stderr entirely, requiring the
marker in the CLI's structured output. That was relaxed (recorded in the
spec's divergences) when the first real capture arrived and lived nowhere
else: agy on a lapsed login exits 1 -- a status it shares with unrelated
errors -- prints nothing to stdout, and says on stderr exactly

    Error: authentication required. Run 'agy' to log in, then retry.

So a stderr marker is allowed, on the condition that keeps the spec's
reasoning intact: it must be that CLI's own sentence, captured verbatim
from a real failure, not a word the CLI might plausibly use. Anything
unrecognised is still `UNKNOWN` rather than guessed at.

**Repeat detection needs no markers at all.** A friend that failed the same
way on two consecutive rounds is not going to succeed on the third, whatever
the cause -- a missing binary, a revoked token, a model name the provider
retired. That rule covers auth without needing to recognise it, and covers
failures nobody has captured a marker for. It disables the friend for the
rest of the run instead of aborting it, because unlike auth it is inferred
rather than declared, and inference should cost less when it is wrong.

agy is the only adapter with a populated marker, captured from a real
failure during a crossexam whose other two friends broke for unrelated
reasons. The others stay empty until someone captures theirs; inventing one
would be exactly the guessing the spec rejects.

One trap, found while probing whether the CLIs honor HTTPS_PROXY: with the
network unreachable, agy prints

    Error: authentication timed out.
    Error: authentication failed or timed out

That reads like the missing marker and must NOT be adopted as one. It is
what agy says when it cannot REACH the auth endpoint, so a marker matching
it would classify every network-denied run as an auth failure -- aborting
the whole run, since auth is treated as declared rather than inferred. A
usable marker has to come from a run with working network and bad
credentials, which is the capture nobody has made yet.
