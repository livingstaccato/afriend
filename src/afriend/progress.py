"""Live progress for a run, written to stderr.

No spec section asks for this. It exists because a crossexam is silent for
tens of minutes and a silent run is indistinguishable from a hung one.
Measured on this project's own source: one codex friend took 357 seconds in
a single round, against a default `--timeout` of 900 -- and three friends
across three rounds is the normal case, not the tail. The only thing the
runner printed in all that time was the run directory, after it was over.

**stderr, never stdout.** `afriend run` prints the run directory on stdout
and nothing else, so a caller can do `cd "$(afriend run spec.md)"`. Progress
sharing that stream would corrupt the one machine-readable thing the command
produces. Every write here goes to the stream this reporter was handed,
which defaults to stderr and is a parameter only so tests can read it back.

**The heartbeat is the part that matters.** A friend that has said nothing
for six minutes looks exactly like a friend that died, and the lifecycle
lines alone cannot tell them apart: they are emitted when something happens,
and the whole problem is that nothing is happening. So a background thread
names what is still outstanding and how long it has been outstanding, which
is the difference between "slow" and "stuck".
