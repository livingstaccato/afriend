    Capability is always the adapter-declared, enforced control for THIS

    Re-deriving it (e.g. `readonly = spec.scope == "repo"`) would silently
    drift from reality for an adapter like opencode, which has no read-only
    control at all. Codex is the measured inverse: its outer read-only OS
    policy is the enforcement even though its inner command argv is not a
    read-only sandbox. The prompt itself is untrusted document text and must
    never influence this value.

    `abort_event`, if given, is passed straight through to
    spawn.run_process so a signal handler in commands.run.cmd_run can stop
    this friend (and reap its whole process group) without waiting out its
    full --timeout -- see cmd_run's signal handling for why this matters: a
    cancelled run must not leave a metered agent CLI process running
    unbounded.

    The kill deadline handed to run_process is `spec.timeout + KILL_GRACE_S`,

    _FAKE_CAPABILITY's own docstring) and are passed straight through to
    spawn.run_process/normalize; see normalize.normalize's docstring.

    `contract` selects which payload kind this friend's output is read as.
    It defaults to claims, so a critique round needs no argument; a
    cross-examination round passes the verdict contract, and the choice
