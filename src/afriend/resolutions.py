"""Verifying a resolution, and deciding whether a gate is clear -- §6.4, §7.5.

**A resolution is an attestation, and this module says so rather than
implying more.** The runner cannot know that a defect was fixed; it can only
check whether the location the author named actually changed. §6.4 is built
around that limit:

* Comparing a whole-artifact hash is not validation. It has the same value
  for every claim in a run, so one trailing newline would satisfy it twelve
  times over.
* A resolution is never rejected merely because the reviewed artifact is
  unchanged. A valid fix for a claim about `docs/design.md` frequently lands
  in `src/auth.py`, and requiring the artifact to change would force dummy
  edits to clear a gate. So what gets verified is the location the evidence
  names, wherever that is.
* A location the runner cannot reconstruct is `unverifiable`. That is valid
  for `rejected` and `accepted-risk`, but cannot support a claim that the
  defect was `fixed`.

A `fixed` disposition therefore requires `location-changed`: unchanged
evidence contradicts the attestation, while unverifiable evidence proves
nothing. Use `accepted-risk` when verification is intentionally unavailable.
