"""One critique round: build each friend's prompt, dispatch, merge claims.

Extracted from commands/run.py when `--mode loop` arrived. A loop iteration
is a whole critique round followed by a whole cross-examination, so the
round-1 body had to become callable more than once per run rather than
inlined in cmd_run.

Round numbering is passed in rather than fixed at 1 for the same reason:
iteration 2's critique is round `max_rounds + 1`, so every round in a run
gets a distinct directory and a distinct number in the ledger.
