"""Continuing a run that halted for the orchestrator -- §4.2.

Round 1 already ran, in the process that exited 10. Its claims are
reconstructed from the ledger rather than re-dispatched: re-running the
critique would spend a full fan-out and produce *different* claims than the
ones the orchestrator just adjudicated, so the adjudication would apply to
ids that no longer exist.

Reconstruction is not a plain read. The ledger deliberately keeps aliased
duplicates as claim records, and every record's `origin` is frozen as first
written -- see merge.canonical_claims for why, and for how corroboration is
folded back in.
