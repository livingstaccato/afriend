"""What a run records about friends the OS has to confine -- §12.2, §12.3.

Split from commands/run.py for the line cap. It is also one concern: every
weakened guarantee a confined friend introduces belongs in the artifact a
human reads, not only in the code that decided it.

    These notes describe what can be known before dispatch. The report's
    per-friend `os_confined` field is derived later from whether dispatch
    actually produced a sandbox wrapper; it is deliberately not inferred
    here from a read-only flag or requested scope.

    The returned list is the run's record that secrets were kept from
    friends, so it must describe what dispatch will actually do
    (`childenv.build(adapter.env_pass, pass_env)`, for every exec friend).
    Computed any other way it is worse than no record: a crossexam of this
    file found `--pass-env` being passed in `withheld`'s *adapter* slot, so
    every name an adapter declares in its own `pass` list -- six API keys,
    for opencode -- was reported as withheld while being handed to the
    child.

    Every exec friend, not only the OS-confined ones. Environment filtering
    used to be gated on the same condition as filesystem confinement, so the
    three CLIs that confine themselves inherited everything; the record
    followed that gate and named only the others.
