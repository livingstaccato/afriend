"""What a `--mode loop --merge orchestrator` halt persists, and how a
resume rebuilds its starting position from it.

Split out of resume.py, which crossed the then-current line cap: that module
is about APPLYING an orchestrator response, this one is about the
loop-level bookkeeping around a halt -- where a resumed iteration re-enters,
what it inherits, and what a halt writes down so a NEW process (a
`--resume` is always a new process) can reconstruct state that would
otherwise live only in memory and vanish the moment the halted process
exits.

Everything here follows one rule: state that must survive a halt has to be
either already in the ledger (verdicts, aliases, claims -- read back by
whoever needs them) or explicitly written into `run.json` by `write_halt`
and explicitly read back by `loop_position`/`resumed_streak`. Several
defects here were exactly the second half of that being missing -- a value
computed and held in memory, never written, so every resume reconstructed
it as zero or as a guess.
