"""Deciding who a run's friends are -- spec §10.1, §13.

Split out of commands/run.py for the line cap. It is also a genuinely
separate decision from running them: four sources can contribute, and §10.1
orders them strongest-last.

    1. the friend's own config   <- default: emit no model/effort flags
    2. --preset
    3. a roster file
    4. --friend

Each layer only fills what the one above left unset, so an operator can keep
a roster and still override a single run from the command line.
