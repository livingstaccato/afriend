"""`afriend run --mode crossexam`: rounds 2..N, friends judging each other.

Round 1 is a critique round and belongs to commands/run.py, which calls
`run_rounds` once it has claims. From here on every round is a judging
round: each friend receives the still-contested claims it did not write
(§7.1), rendered blind (§5.1), and returns one verdict each.

The decisions this file makes are all IO and bookkeeping. Every rule that
decides an outcome -- who may judge, what settles, what deadlocks, what is
discarded, what an amendment becomes -- lives in verdicts.py as pure
functions, and is tested there without a subprocess in sight.

    claim `contested` and re-judged claims it had already settled -- and a
