"""One round of fan-out: isolate every friend, dispatch in parallel, collect.

Extracted from commands/run.py when cross-examination arrived. A judging
round needs exactly the same machinery a critique round does -- a private
worktree or doc directory per friend, a thread per friend, teardown that runs
whatever happens, and an abort path that does not wait out a hung friend's
full timeout -- and the alternative was a second copy of it in commands/
diverging from the first.

Nothing here knows what a friend was asked. It takes a prompt file per friend
and returns a SpawnResult per friend; whether that prompt held a critique
contract or a verdict contract is the caller's business.

    An auth-abort message or mid-dispatch error is returned rather than

    round's output -- including from friends that succeeded -- the moment
    ANY friend in the round hit a deterministic auth failure. The caller
    persists and merges every result exactly as it would for a normal
    round, then decides what an auth abort means for it.

    Every friend gets its own private working directory, torn down at the end
    regardless of how dispatch finishes (including on a raised exception, or
    an abort mid-setup). Repo-scope friends run inside their own git worktree
    checked out from one shared snapshot commit; every other friend runs
    inside its own bare doc_scope_dir holding only a copy of the artifact.

    Giving every repo-scope friend its own worktree (rather than one shared
    checkout) is a deliberately stricter reading of "every friend that lacks
    a readonly capability gets its own private worktree": it trivially
    satisfies that bar and removes any question of two friends racing each
    other inside one worktree, at the cost of one `git worktree add` per
    friend. The run directory itself is never nested inside any of these.
