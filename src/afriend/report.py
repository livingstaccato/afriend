"""Render report.md.

The header states the requested model, where that selection came from, and
the effort each friend received. Without that, a weak critique from a friend
that silently ran at default effort reads as a signal about the artifact when
it is really a signal about the flag matrix -- and a run where several
friends failed would otherwise read as a clean bill of health. Every friend
is listed, including failures, and the empty-findings case says explicitly
that it is not the same as "no problems found."

`render` is a pure function: it only reads its arguments and returns a
string. It never writes files, never mutates `claims`/`aliases`/`run_meta`,
and never calls anything external.

`claim`, `evidence`, `failure_scenario`, and `suggested_fix` are untrusted
prose straight from an adversarial friend's stdout, as are `downgrades`
notes. A line in any of those fields that happens to start with a Markdown
block construct -- an ATX heading (`#`), a fence (backtick run or `~~~`), a
blockquote (`>`), a list marker (`-`/`+`/`*`/`1.`), or a table pipe (`|`) --
is otherwise interpreted as real document structure once concatenated into
report.md. A claim whose text opens with `### c-9999@1 -- critical` renders
as a second, fabricated finding indistinguishable from a real one; a claim
whose evidence contains an unterminated code fence swallows every
subsequent line of the document -- every following claim -- into one inert
code block. `_escape_block` neutralizes exactly the leading marker on each
line so these fields still render as prose, without collapsing newlines or
wrapping the field in a code block of its own.

# A line-initial (up to 3 spaces of indentation) Markdown block construct:
# ATX heading, blockquote, bullet/thematic-break marker, table pipe, a
# backtick run (fence or inline span), a tilde fence, an ordered-list
# marker, a Setext H1 underline, or an HTML block start. Bullet/ordered-list
# markers require a trailing space/EOL per CommonMark (so inline uses like
# "*emphasis*", "-5 is negative", or "1.5" are left alone), but a run of 2+
# of the same -/+/* character followed by space/EOL is matched too, since a
# bare line of "---" or "***" is a thematic break (or, under the previous
# line, a Setext heading underline) even with no space after it -- the
# single-marker-plus-space check alone would miss that.
#
# "=" runs: a line consisting of nothing but "=" characters (plus optional
# trailing whitespace) is a Setext H1 underline -- it turns the PRECEDING
# line into a heading, with no leading marker of its own on the underline
# line itself. Per CommonMark this only counts when the entire rest of the
# line is blank, hence the lookahead (unlike "---", "===" has no other
# meaning to preserve, e.g. as a horizontal rule, so this is Setext-only).
#
# "<": CommonMark opens an HTML block on a line-initial "<" (a tag, a
# processing instruction, a declaration, or a comment opener) with no
# "space after the marker" requirement at all -- unescaped, a raw HTML
# block reads straight through to `cmark` (or GitHub's renderer) untouched.
# This single alternative also covers "<!--": an HTML comment block that
# terminates at "-->", not at the next blank line or heading, so left
# unescaped it can swallow every following claim into one inert (and,
# worse, literally invisible -- comments don't render at all) span.
# Reproduced directly: an `evidence` field starting with "<!--" and never
# closing ate 3 of 3 findings under `cmark`.

    backticks strictly longer than the longest backtick run inside the

    of padding on that side keeps the delimiter from fusing with it.

    space from a code span's content whenever that content both begins and
    ends with a space (and isn't made entirely of spaces) -- so content
    like " abc " needs one extra space of padding on each side to survive
    that stripping and still display as " abc ". The two padding reasons

    exactly one space on each side is enough to round-trip the original
